# ORCR
This repository contains codes for MC simulations and experiments in `Overfitting reduction in convex regression` paper.
# Functions
In main path, we list all functions used in experiements.
* DGP.jl: data-generating process.
* estimator.jl: all convex least squares estimators for computations.
* MC.jl: MC simulations, return MSE for each method.
* toolbox.jl: cross validation for tuning parameters.
# Experiments
* illustration directory contains codes for MC simulations Section 5.1.
* simulations directory refers to the rest experiments in MC simulations.
